# Fruitails
**Fruitails** is a split screen catch game with an interactive mat controller. Players control the movement of two characters, with their feet, at the same time. There are four buttons on the mat for arrow keys. LED lights are synced with all keypress to indicate that the mat is responsive.

## Instructions - How To Build

### I. Build your own Mat controller!

#### Materials:
* Aluminum foil tape
* Conductive thread
* Needle

#### Steps:
1. Divide mat into four equal quadrants.

2. Use Aluminum foil tape to map out the shape of the arrows on the top of the mat.

3. Using conductive thread, sew underneath the mat following the pattern of the blue lines below. Ensure that the thread is connected to the foil tape on the top.

4. Leave strands of conductive thread at the ends to later connect with the Makey Makey.

### II. Connect your mat controller to the Makey Makey!

#### Materials:
* Classic Makey Makey board
* Alligator clips
* Wires

#### Steps:
1. Plug in the Classic Makey Makey board with the USB cord to your computer.

2. Download and install the Arduino IDE with the Makey Makey Firmware using the following online resource [MaKey MaKey Advanced Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/makey-makey-advanced-guide).

3. In settings.h tab, modify the inputs for the click button pad, space button pad, right arrow pad and left arrow pad to ‘a’, ‘s’, ‘k’, and ‘l’.

  ```
  //Modifications to the ‘settings.h’ settings from makey_makey_1_4_2.ino (Arduino IDE)

  int keyCodes[NUM_INPUTS] = {

    KEY_UP_ARROW,      // up arrow pad
    KEY_DOWN_ARROW,    // down arrow pad
    'k',     // left arrow pad
    'l',     // right arrow pad
    's',     // space button pad
    'a',     // click button pad

    //back left side (keyboard pins)
    'w',                // pin D5
    'a',                // pin D4
    's',                // pin D3
    'd',                // pin D2
    'f',                // pin D1
    'g',                // pin D0

    //back right side (mouse pins)

    MOUSE_MOVE_UP,      // pin A5
    MOUSE_MOVE_DOWN,    // pin A4
    MOUSE_MOVE_LEFT,    // pin A3
    MOUSE_MOVE_RIGHT,   // pin A2
    MOUSE_LEFT,         // pin A1
    MOUSE_RIGHT         // pin A0
  };

  ```

4. As depicted in the diagram below, use alligator clips to connect the following together (from the back of the Makey Makey to the end strands of the conductive thread from the mat).

5. Extend the ground of the Makey Makey by connect together five alligator clips from the ground pad and to the player’s hand.

### III. Connect the LED lights!

#### Materials:
* Breadboard
* LED lights

#### Steps:
1. Use wires to extend the D14 (keyboard) output to the negative and ground to the positive input of the breadboard. 

2. Connect LED light negative to breadboard negative, ground to breadboard ground

### IV. Build the game

Build the game using [Zim](http://zimjs.com/code/), a JavaScript framework for HTML Canvas powered by CreateJS

1. Load game assets
2. Run a startGame function to call on all functions at the start of the game
3. Define character assets and their position
4. Define game item assets and put them in containers
5. Add a parallax background scroller
6. Call music assets
7. Define lanes
8. Add event listeners to control movement of players
9. Add scoring system and progress bar
10. Function to clone game items, position and set speed
11. Clone items are added to a container
12. Animate the coins and traps downward with an ease of linear
13. Coins and traps fall randomly at different speeds (varied by wait time)
14. Function for hit tests when game items (coin or trap) hits a character
15. Increment score when character collects a coin
16. Sends to gameover screen when character hits a rock
17. Deletes traps if they go off stage
18. Hit test to check if fruit and trap overlap, removes trap if they do
19. Create links between index screen, instructions screen, game and gameover screen
